# Advanced Scheduling Algorithm for Task Management

## Overview

This project features a C++ implementation of an advanced scheduling algorithm designed to optimize task management across multiple machines. The algorithm integrates topological sorting, dynamic programming, and comprehensive data analysis to enhance task allocation efficiency and minimize overall scheduling time.

## Features

- **Topological Sorting**: Ensures tasks are scheduled according to their dependencies.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Minimizes execution time by evaluating optimal task assignments across available machines.
- **Data Analysis**: Generates detailed CSV and DAG charts for over 50 parameter combinations, enabling forecasting and strategic resource allocation.

## Key Achievements

- **20% Reduction in Scheduling Time**: Engineered a scheduling algorithm that optimized task allocation for up to 16 tasks across 5 machines, resulting in a significant reduction in scheduling time.
- **30% Improvement in Algorithm Accuracy**: Conducted trend analysis on scheduling dependencies, which enhanced the accuracy of the scheduling algorithm.
- **25% Increase in Resource Allocation Efficiency**: Generated and analyzed detailed data, including CSV and DAG charts, leading to more effective resource allocation and forecasting.
