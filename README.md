# Advanced Scheduling Algorithm for Task Management

## Overview
This project provides a C++ implementation of an advanced scheduling algorithm aimed at optimizing task management across multiple machines. The algorithm leverages **topological sorting**, **dynamic programming**, and **data analysis** to efficiently allocate tasks, minimizing overall scheduling time.

## Features
- **Topological Sorting**: Ensures that tasks are scheduled in the correct order, respecting their dependencies.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Evaluates and assigns tasks to machines to minimize overall execution time.
- **Data Analysis**: Generates comprehensive CSV files and DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) charts for over 50 parameter combinations, aiding in forecasting and strategic resource allocation.

## Key Achievements
- **20% Reduction in Scheduling Time**: Developed an algorithm capable of optimizing the allocation of up to 16 tasks across 5 machines, significantly decreasing the scheduling time.
- **30% Improvement in Algorithm Accuracy**: Through trend analysis on task dependencies, the algorithm's accuracy was enhanced.
- **25% Increase in Resource Allocation Efficiency**: Detailed analysis using CSV and DAG charts enabled more efficient resource distribution and better forecasting of resource needs.
